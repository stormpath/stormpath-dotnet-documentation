.. _configuration:


Configuration
=============

The Stormpath |framework| library provides several options that allow you to customize the authentication features of your |framework| application. This section will cover how to configure the library in general, and later sections will go into detail on specific features.

The default configuration enables a lot of functionality by default, but you may want to customize the behavior of the library to suit the needs of your application.

There are a few ways you can set these configuration options:

* :ref:`API credentials file <config_apiKey>` (for the API key ID and secret only) in ``~/.stormpath`` or the app root
* :ref:`Markup file (YAML or JSON) <config_markup>` in ``~/.stormpath`` or the app root
* :ref:`Environment variables <config_env>`
* :ref:`Inline options in code <config_inline>` (supplied to the middleware constructor)


.. _config_loading_order:

Loading order
-------------

These configuration methods are loaded in the order above. This means that values supplied via inline code will override any values supplied via environment variables for the same settings. Likewise, values supplied via environment variables will override values supplied via a JSON or YAML file for the same settings.

Any settings that are not specified using **any** method will fall back to the `Web Configuration Defaults`_.


Required settings
-----------------

At the very least, these configuration options **must** be set in order for
the Stormpath middleware to initialize properly:

* ``stormpath.client.apiKey.id``
* ``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret``

Additionally, if you have more than one Application resource in your Stormpath tenant, either ``stormpath.application.name`` or ``stormpath.application.href`` must be set.

If these values aren't set (using one of the methods below), the Stormpath middleware component with throw an error on startup.


.. _config_apiKey:

API credentials file
--------------------

The API Key ID (``stormpath.client.apiKey.id``) and API Key Secret (``stormpath.client.apiKey.secret``) can be set by placing the ``apiKey.properties`` generated by the Stormpath Admin Console file in one of these locations:

* ``~/.stormpath/`` (where ``~`` represents the user's home directory)
* The application's base directory

If you don't opt to store the Stormpath API credentials in environment variables, this functionality makes it easy to download the ``apiKey.properties`` file from Stormpath and place it directly in one of these locations.


.. _config_markup:

Markup file (YAML or JSON)
--------------------------

Configuration options can also be set by placing a file called ``stormpath.yaml`` or ``stormpath.json`` in one of these locations:

* **Hidden .stormpath Directory**

On Unix-like machines, the path ``~/.stormpath/`` is searched.

On Windows machines, the path is ``%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%%\.stormpath``. This is typically resolved to ``C:\Users\<username>\.stormpath``.

* **Application Base Directory**

.. only:: aspnetcore

  The application's base directory is defined as the directory that ``project.json`` or ``appsettings.json`` resides in.

.. only:: aspnet

  The application's base directory is defined as the directory that ``web.config`` resides in.

For example, this ``stormpath.yaml`` file will disable the default ``/register`` and ``/login`` routes:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  web:
    register:
      enabled: false
    login:
      enabled: false

The equivalent ``stormpath.json`` is:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "web": {
      "register": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "login": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }

In both cases, the ``stormpath`` root node is implied and should be omitted.

.. tip::
  You can also refer to the `Example Stormpath configuration`_ to see the entire default library configuration in YAML.


.. _config_env:

Environment variables
---------------------

Configuration options can be set in environment variables by formatting the key name with underscores. For example, ``stormpath.client.apiKey.id`` becomes ``STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID``.

.. tip::
  It is a best practice to store confidential information in environment
  variables, to avoid hard-coding it into your application. We recommend you store your confidential Stormpath information (API credentials and application URL) in this way.

In a bash-like shell, you can set environment variables by running these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    export STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID=your_id_here
    export STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET=your_secret_here
    export STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF=your_app_href

On Windows, the commands are:

.. code-block:: powershell

    setx STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID your_id_here
    setx STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET your_secret_here
    setx STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF your_app_href

Any configuration option can be set using environment variables. The above are just examples!


.. _config_inline:

Inline options
--------------

If you wish to define your configuration in code, you can do so when initializing the middleware.

Values set using inline code have the highest precedence and will override any values set with other methods, such as a markup file. (See :ref:`config_loading_order`.)

The middleware accepts a parameter of type ``StormpathConfiguration`` (found in ``Stormpath.Configuration.Abstractions``):

.. only:: aspnetcore

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnetcore/inline_config.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnet/inline_config.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: nancy

  .. .literalinclude:: code/configuration/nancy/inline_config.cs
      :language: csharp

You can also use an anonymous object with the same (case-insensitive) names:

.. only:: aspnetcore

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnetcore/anonymous_inline_config.cs
    :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnet/anonymous_inline_config.cs
    :language: csharp

.. only:: nancy

  .. .literalinclude:: code/configuration/nancy/anonymous_inline_config.cs
    :language: csharp

Both of these examples will use the Stormpath Application called "My Application" and disable the default ``/register`` route.

.. tip::
  The most flexible way of providing configuration in a production environment is with YAML/JSON markup or environment variables. Inline options are useful during development.


.. _default_features:

Default features
----------------

When you add the Stormpath middleware to your application pipeline,
the library will automatically add the following routes to your application:

+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| URI          | Purpose                                                     | Documentation             |
+==============+=============================================================+===========================+
| /forgot      | Request a password reset link.                              | :ref:`password_reset`     |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /change      | Reset your password (second step)                           | :ref:`password_reset`     |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /login       | Login to your application with username and password.       | :ref:`login`              |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /logout      | Accepts a POST request, and destroys the login session.     | :ref:`logout`             |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /me          | Returns a JSON representation of the current user.          | :ref:`me_api`             |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /oauth/token | Issue OAuth2 access and refresh tokens.                     | :ref:`oauth2`             |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /register    | Create an account within your application.                  | :ref:`registration`       |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /reset       | Reset an account password, from a password reset link.      | :ref:`password_reset`     |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| /verify      | Verify a new account, from a email verification link.       | :ref:`email_verification` |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+

Each feature has its own configurable options, which are explained in the feature's documentation. If you want to disable specific features, continue to the next section.


Disabling features
------------------

The library enables many features by default, but you might not want to use all of them.
For example, if you wanted to disable all the default features, you could use
this configuration in code:

.. only:: aspnetcore

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnetcore/disable_default_features.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnet/disable_default_features.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: nancy

  .. .literalinclude:: code/configuration/nancy/disable_default_features.cs
      :language: csharp

The equivalent ``stormpath.yaml`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  web:
    forgotPassword:
      enabled: false

    changePassword:
      enabled: false

    login:
      enabled: false

    logout:
      enabled: false

    me:
      enabled: false

    oauth2:
      enabled: false

    register:
      enabled: false

    verifyEmail:
      enabled: false


You could also achieve the same result using environment variables, by setting ``STORMPATH_WEB_LOGIN_ENABLED = 'false'`` and so on.


Disabling content types
-----------------------

By default, the routes provided by this library can handle requests from both browsers and clients such as Single Page Applications and mobile apps. Incoming requests are inspected for an Accept header of either ``text/html`` (browsers) or ``application/json`` (SPA/mobile).

It's possible to disable either of these modes by changing the values in ``stormpath.web.produces``. For example, if you want to build a pure API that will never send HTML responses, use this configuration:

.. only:: aspnetcore

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnetcore/disable_html_produces.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnet/disable_html_produces.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: nancy

  .. .literalinclude:: code/configuration/nancy/disable_html_produces.cs
      :language: csharp

Specifying the server URI
-------------------------

Some :ref:`social_login` providers require the base URI of your server to be set in configuration. To do this, you can set the ``stormpath.web.serverUri`` property using one of the configuration methods described in this section.

For example, in YAML:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  stormpath:
    web:
     serverUri: http://localhost:5000

Alternatively, you can set this property in code when you configure the Stormpath middleware:

.. only:: aspnetcore

 .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnetcore/server_uri.cs
   :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

 .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnet/server_uri.cs
   :language: csharp

.. only:: nancy

 .. .literalinclude:: code/configuration/nancy/anonymous_inline_config.cs
   :language: csharp


Stormpath Client options
------------------------

When you initialize this library, it creates an instance of the Stormpath SDK Client.
The Stormpath Client is responsible for communicating with the Stormpath REST
API and is provided by the `Stormpath .NET SDK`_.

Any options you set when initializing the Stormpath middleware library are also passed down to the SDK Client.

For example, to hardcode the Stormpath API credentials (not recommended!), you could use this configuration:

.. only:: aspnetcore

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnetcore/api_credentials.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

  .. literalinclude:: code/configuration/aspnet/api_credentials.cs
      :language: csharp

.. only:: nancy

  .. .literalinclude:: code/configuration/nancy/api_credentials.cs
      :language: csharp

The Stormpath Client constructor ignores the ``stormpath.web`` node of the configuration. For more information about setting options on the SDK Client object, please see the
`.NET SDK documentation <https://docs.stormpath.com/dotnet/api/html/M_Stormpath_SDK_Client_IClientBuilder_SetConfiguration.htm>`_.
