Password Reset
==============

Stormpath provides a self-service password reset flow for your users, allowing them to request a link that resets their password. This library adds this functionality to your |framework| application automatically if it is enabled on your Stormpath Directory.

By default, this library will serve a Forgot Password form at ``/forgot`` and a callback handler at ``/change``, *if* the Password Reset Email workflow is enabled in Stormpath. You can change these URIs, or disable the feature entirely if you wish (see :ref:`password_reset_configuration`).


Enabling the Workflow
---------------------

To use the password reset workflow, you need to configure the Stormpath Directory your application is using. Follow these steps:

1. Use the `Stormpath Admin Console`_ to find the Stormpath Directory linked to your Application.
2. Navigate to the Workflows section and enable the **Password Reset Email** workflow.
3. Modify the **Link Base URL** to point to your application:

.. code-block:: sh

    http://yourapplication.com/change

.. note::
  The ``/change`` route is automatically provided by this library. If you want to change the route URI, see :ref:`password_reset_configuration`.


How it Works
------------

After enabling the workflow in Stormpath, restart your |framework| application.  You can now complete a self-service password reset:

* The login form at ``/login`` will show a "Forgot Password?" link.
* Clicking that link will take you to ``/forgot``, where you can enter your email address.
* After you receive the email, clicking on the link will take you to ``/change``.
* You'll see a form that allows you to enter a new password.
* After changing your password, you will be taken to the login form.

Configuration Options
---------------------

There are several options you can configure using code or markup (see the :ref:`Configuration` section). These options are split between the two steps of the workflow.

.. note::
  The **enabled** properties for these routes can be set to ``true``, ``false``, or ``null``. A value of ``null`` means that the route will automatically be enabled if the default Account Store for the current Stormpath application has the Password Reset Email workflow enabled.

Forgot Route
............

The first step in the password reset flow displays a form where the user can enter their email address. The configuration options for this route are in the section ``stormpath.web.forgotPassword``:

* **enabled**: Whether the feature is enabled. (Default: ``null``, see note above)
* **uri**: The path for this feature. (Default: ``/forgot``)
* **nextUri**: Where to send the user after they request a reset email. (Default: ``/login?status=forgot``)
* **view**: The view to render; see :ref:`templates`. (Default: ``forgot-password``)

Change Route
............

The second step in the password reset flow displays a form where the user can enter their new password, given a valid link. The configuration options for this route are in the section ``stormpath.web.changePassword``:

* **enabled**: Whether the feature is enabled. (Default: ``null``, see note above)
* **uri**: The path for this feature. (Default: ``/change``)
* **nextUri**: Where to send the user after changing their password. (Default: ``/login?status=reset``, but see :ref:`password_reset_auto_login`)
* **view**: The view to render; see :ref:`templates`. (Default: ``change-password``)
* **errorUri**: Where to send the user if the link is invalid. (Default: ``/forgot?status=invalid_sptoken``)

.. note::
  Any unchanged options will retain their default values. See the :ref:`password_reset_default_configuration` section to view the defaults.

Configuration Example
.....................

You could, for example, change the route paths for both endpoints by setting this configuration (shown as YAML):

.. code-block:: yaml

  web:
    forgotPassword:
      uri: "/forgot-password"
    changePassword:
      uri: "/change-password"

You could also set this configuration via code:

.. only:: aspnetcore

  .. literalinclude:: code/password_reset/aspnetcore/configure_uris.cs
    :language: csharp

.. only:: aspnet

  .. todo::
    Add code

.. only:: nancy

  .. todo::
    Add code

See the :ref:`configuration` section for more details on how configuration works, or :ref:`password_reset_default_configuration` to see the default values for these routes.


.. _password_reset_auto_login:

Auto Login
----------

Our library implements the most secure workflow by default: the user must request a password reset link, then log in again after changing their password.

By default, the user is redirected to ``/login?status=reset`` (the value of ``changePassword.nextUri``), which renders the login form with a status message indicating that the password has been reset successfully.

If :ref:`auto_login` is enabled, the user will be automatically logged in after they reset their password. The user will **not** be redirected to ``changePassword.nextUri``, but instead will be redirected to ``register.nextUri``.


Mobile/JSON API
---------------

If you are using this library from a mobile application, or a client framework like Angular or React, you'll interact with these endpoints via GET and POST requests.

To start the password reset flow, send a POST request to ``/forgot``:

.. code-block:: http

  POST /forgot
  Accept: application/json
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "email": "foo@bar.com"
  }

The ``/forgot`` endpoint will always respond with ``200 OK``, regardless of whether the email address is valid.

If you have a valid ``sptoken``, you can complete the password reset flow by sending a POST to ``/change`` with the user's new password:

.. code-block:: http

  POST /change
  Accept: application/json
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "sptoken": "the sent token",
    "password": "new password"
  }


.. _password_reset_default_configuration:

Default Configuration
---------------------

Options that are not overridden by explicit configuration (see :ref:`configuration`) will retain their default values.

For reference, the full default configuration for these routes is shown as YAML below:

.. code-block:: yaml

  web:
    forgotPassword:
      enabled: null
      uri: "/forgot"
      view: "forgot-password"
      nextUri: "/login?status=forgot"

    changePassword:
      enabled: null
      uri: "/change"
      nextUri: "/login?status=reset"
      view: "change-password"
      errorUri: "/forgot?status=invalid_sptoken"
